# JWT Authentication Fix Summary

## âœ… Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Firebase Authentication JSON Format
- Added support for both form-encoded and JSON-based Firebase authentication
- Created a new `FirebaseAuthRequest` model to properly structure the request
- Implemented fallback mechanism to try both request formats

### 2. Improved Authentication Flow
- Enhanced `UserRepository.authenticateWithFirebase()` to try multiple authentication methods
- Better error handling and logging throughout the authentication process
- Added proper token validation and storage

### 3. API Integration
- Added new `authenticateWithFirebaseJson()` endpoint to ApiService
- Fixed JWT token handling in authentication response
- Improved handling of the `access_token` in the response

### 4. Diagnostics and Testing
- Fixed potential issues with token format in the diagnostic utility
- Enhanced logging to better identify authentication problems
- Added better error reporting to diagnose backend connectivity issues

## How to Test the Changes

1. **Launch the app** and navigate to the login screen
2. **Log in** with your credentials
3. **Check authentication status** by:
   - Tapping on the profile picture 7 times in the Profile tab
   - Selecting "Run Auth Diagnostic"
   - Reviewing the logs in Android Studio

## Expected Behavior

- The authentication process should now work with either form-encoded or JSON requests
- The JWT token should be properly saved and used in all API requests
- The Cart and Order APIs should now work properly with JWT authentication

## Remaining Considerations

- Monitor logs for any remaining authentication issues
- Check backend server logs to ensure proper Firebase token validation
- Verify cart and order operations complete successfully

If you encounter any issues, use the built-in diagnostic tools to identify the problem area.
